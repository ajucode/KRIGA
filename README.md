KRIGA
=====

Introduction
-----------
KRIGA is a library for computing Gaussian process regression, also know as kriging, based in a PGAS 
programming model and designed over the [Global Arrays](https://github.com/GlobalArrays/ga) toolkit.

It is expected that KRIGA will implement different class of kriging methods, listed here:
- Simple kriging
- Ordinary kriging
- Universal kriging or Regression kriging (currently under development)

In a future we expect to create implement some optimization methods based in surrogate-models that
are build with kriging approximations.
